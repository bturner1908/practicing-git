Jules: Big Kahuna Burger. That's that Hawaiian burger joint. I hear they got some tasty burgers. I ain't never had one myself. How are they?
Brett: They're good.
Jules: Mind if I try one of yours? This is yours here, right?
Jules: Mmm-mmmm. That is a tasty burger. Vincent, ever have a Big Kahuna Burger?


The Wolf: Pretty please with sugar on top, now clean the effin' car.
